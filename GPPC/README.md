[//]: # (This is GPPC)
This is a dumb thingy I made to compile pP, the esolang I made to torture my programmer friends.<br>
Yay?<br>
Do feel free to check out [the credits](__CREDITS__.txt).<br>

To demonstrate how dumb this esolang is, I included a hello world program (main.ppsc)<br>
Also, [source/GPPC.py](source/GPPC.py) is the source code.<br>
Have fun modding this! (if you want)<br>

And, since I got bored, I also made ppi.exe, which is an interpreter/shell for pP.<br>
[source/PPI.py](source/PPI.py) is the source.<br>
