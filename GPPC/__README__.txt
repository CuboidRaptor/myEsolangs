This is a dumb thingy I made to compile pP, the esolang I made to torture my programmer friends.
Yay?
Do feel free to check out __CREDITS__.txt.

To demonstrate how dumb this esolang is, I included a hello world program (main.ppsc)
Also, source/GPPC.py is the source code.
Have fun modding this! (if you want)

And, since I got bored, I also made ppi.exe, which is an interpreter/shell for pP.
source/PPI.py is the source.
